Stock Price Prediction
This project is an AI-driven Stock Price Prediction System that uses historical market data and machine learning techniques to forecast future stock prices. The aim is to provide a tool that can help investors, researchers, and financial enthusiasts understand market trends and make more informed decisions.
The system collects and processes stock market data, including historical prices, trading volumes, and patterns. Using this data, it trains machine learning models that can identify trends and predict the possible movement of stock prices. By applying techniques such as time-series analysis, regression, and deep learning (LSTMs/GRUs), the project delivers accurate and data-driven forecasts.
